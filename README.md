# Lua-Object-Factory
Designed using RBX.lua.

This generic object factory is the product of an evolutionary factory learning process. Built entirely from scratch, with the only exception being a functionally modified version of [Quenty's Signal](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/6ca66a994dba630ad9ac0e2208ac3b8b6630b053/Modules/Events/Signal.lua).
